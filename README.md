## How It Works

- **Fetch Current Notices**: The application fetches the latest notices from the IOM website using Axios and Cheerio.
- **Fetch Saved Notices**: The application reads previously saved notices from savedNotices.json.
- **Check for New Notices**: The application compares the current notices with the saved notices to identify any new notices.
- **Notify**: If there are any new notices, the application sends desktop notifications using node-notifier.
- **Save Notices**: The application updates savedNotices.json with any new notices.
- **Scheduling**: The application uses @breejs/later to schedule the notice fetching process to run every hour.
