    git clone https://github.com/rohityadav-sas/Notice-Alert-CLI
    ```
    
2. Navigate to the source directory:

    cd Notice-Alert-CLI
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies

    ```

## Usage

- Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.

- Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.

- Install the required dependencies using npm install.

- Run the application with optional arguments:

    - To run the application with a specific interval:
        ```bash
        npx iomnotice -interval duration
        ```
        OR
        ```bash
        npx ioenotice -interval duration
        ```

        Duration can be in hours (hr or h), minutes (min or m), or seconds (sec or s).

        For example:
        ```bash
        npx iomnotice -interval 30min
        
        npx ioenotice -interval 1hr
        ```

    - To run the application with default settings (1 hour interval):
        ```bash
        npx iomnotice
        ```
        OR
        ```bash
        npx ioenotice
        ```

    - To see usage instructions:
        ```bash
        npx iomnotice -help
        ```
        OR 
        ```bash
        npx ioenotice -help
        ```

## How It Works

- **Fetch Current Notices**: The application fetches the latest notices from the IOE and IOM website using Axios and Cheerio.

- **Fetch Saved Notices**: The application reads previously saved notices from saved Notices.

- **Check for New Notices**: The application compares the current notices with the saved notices to identify any new 
notices.

- **Notify**: If there are any new notices, the application sends desktop notifications using node-notifier.

- **Save Notices**: The application updates the Notices file with any new notices.

- **Scheduling**: The application allows scheduling the notice fetching process with customizable intervals.
